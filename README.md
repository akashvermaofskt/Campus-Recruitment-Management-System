### ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project named “Campus Recruitment Management System”, is a
student/company information system which is a web-based system. The
project is developed for Placement cell being presently used in University
for storing and retrieving the information of students who are registered in
Placement Cell. The Placement Cell maintains a large database of students
wherein all the information of students including personal records and the
academic performance in terms C.P.I. is stored and company information
including profile of company, eligibility criteria and facilities it provides
etc. The software retrieves this data and displays as per the user
requirement.

The Placement Management System is developed as an attempt to take
a record of company and students by restricting such a large database to that
of a particular class of students or company. The system provides the
facility of viewing both the personal and academic information of the
student and company. Company can post vacancy and students can apply if
they are eligible. Company can view the applications and can accept or
reject them.

The project is to facilitate students in college, company to register and
communicate with Placement Cell. The users access easily to this and the
data can be retrieved easily in no time. In the main page there are options
for Student/Company/Admin login and for registration of new students and
companies as well. In student registration form, we can give personal
details, educational qualifications etc. Student can see the information of
various registered companies and the details of vacancies provided by them
on their dashboard. They can apply for the job by checking eligibility. In
Company registration form the companies can give their details and they
can provide vacancies for different job profiles by vacancy registration
form. List of applied and eligible students is displayed on their dashboard
and thus they can accept or reject their application. The administrator can
execute different queries like details of registered students and companies,
placed students, job profiles etc. and can delete the records as well.
